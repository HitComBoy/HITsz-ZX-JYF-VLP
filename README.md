This is my postgraduate master research project
## Research Direction
My postgraduate project is about indoor visible light positioning, mainly to solve the limitation of indoor visible light positioning on the number of visible light sources and sensors at the receiving end and propose a corresponding high-precision visible light positioning method.
## Our Contribution
- We propose a rotational positioning model
- We use particle swarm algorithm to solve the above model
- We find the CRLB under the model-specific parameters
- We verified the localization effect of the model during mobile
- We verified the influence of different parameters on the final positioning effect
